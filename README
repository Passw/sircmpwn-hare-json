This module provides an implementation of the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
format, defined by RFC 7159. A lexer for JSON values is provided, which may be
initialized with [[lex]] and provides tokens via [[next]], and which uses a
relatively small amount of memory and provides relatively few gurantees
regarding the compliance of the input with the JSON grammar.

Additionally, the [[value]] type is provided to store any value JSON value, as
well as helpers like [[newobject]], [[get]], and [[set]]. One can load a JSON
value from an input stream into a heap-allocated [[value]] via [[load]], which
enforces all of JSON's grammar constraints and returns an object which must be
freed with [[finish]].
